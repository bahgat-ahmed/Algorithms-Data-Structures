# Algorithms & Data Structures

Algorithms, and Data Structures are very important to understand for any software engineer for being able to code efficiently. During my practice in Problem Solving, and in my career, I find some very useful algorithms, and data structures that I have to understand how to use, and when to use. 

Therefore in this repository I am going to put Python files that include the use of:
1. Ready available useful algorithms and data structures implemented in Python that I want to have reference for how to use them.
2. Known useful algorithms and data structures that I coded with myself to understand these different algorithms, and data structures on a deeper level.

During my practice, I practiced in this [Python Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/bahgat94/algorithms-data-structures/edit) on Kaggle kernel, then I copied different codes from there into different python files for uploading them to this repository.
